What am I doing?

1. I need to build something that will detect the presence of three walls.
2. Maze width: 200mm
3. Robot width: 130mm

Here's what I want to do. Im thinking of using the exact circuit Justin showed us in class.

It the basic three LEDS, three photodiodes version with some other features.

What do I still need to do:
1. confirm that this circuit actually works in the lab.
2. design the pcb
3. get jlcpcb set up
